version 6.2
	Corrections

	Corrected bug in DTR/RTS reporting latency seen if you set DTR/RTS and ask for it before the
	device has reported it to the host - now when it is written it reads back immediately

	Corrected several USB requests that were improperly defined as device requests when they are actually
	interface requests - this doesn't exhibit and bugs in current single interface devices but was changed

	fully sent out USB
