Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. If your device supports CAB installation then copy the CP210xVCP_CE_Install.<platform>.CAB file which
	matches your platform to the device. Run it, and install into the Windows directory when
	prompted. If your device does not support CAB installation copy the CP210xVCP.DLL driver into
	the \Windows directory.

2. Plug in the CP210x Device with VID 10C4 and PID EA60. If your CP210x needs customization follow
	the instructions in the CP210xVCP.REG file to add your device entry to the registry. Then
	to customze the device use the CP210xSetIDs.exe application located in AN144 and its software
	package (AN144SW) available here: 

	http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/en/mcu_applications_appnotes.htm

	There is also a sample INF file for CAB file installation. To customize this install follow
	the instructions in the same CP210xVCP_CE_Install.INF file.
 
3. When the dialog pops up saying "Unidentified USB Device" enter CP210xVCP for
	the driver name. The dialog should close when OK is pressed, and the LED on 
	the CP210x development board should be lit (If the dialog doesn't pop up, but 
	the LED on the CP210x development board is on, then it automatically found the 
	device).

	If your device is customized this will not work and you will need to either
	manually enter customized registry entries from the CP210xVCP.REG file, or you will
	need to customize the INF to build a CAB installer (which will add the regsitry
	entries automatically).

4. The included test application can now be run (CP210xSerialTest.exe) using a two COM ports, one
	which should be a CP210x, or a single CP210x in loopback mode (this is done by spcifying the
	same COM port as the Master and the Slave. To put the device in a loopback state, disconnect
	the two jumpers for TXD and RXD, and reconnect one jumper joining the TXD and RXD pins
	closest to the USB port - see Figure 1.

Release History
---------------

Release 2.1
-----------
- Added support for CP2104/5
- Changed the way modem status is polled, before it used a mmtimer library which would
cause the device to lag for 10 seconds upon device removal and unload of the driver

Release 2.0a
------------
- Removed the BuiltIn key, it was causing a 10 second boot time lag on certain systems. This
key was removed since the driver doesn't need to be loaded at boot, only on device insertion

Release 2.0
-----------
- Corrected default installation behavior
- Corrected functionality to get/set/wait on COMM events
- Added support to read/write GPIO latch values with the CP210xRuntime.DLL

Release 1.0
-----------
- Initial Release
